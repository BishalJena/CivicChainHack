## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: *"Building Transparent and Accountable Governance Systems"*  

Traditional grievance management systems lack transparency, accountability, and often suffer from spam complaints and inefficient tracking. Citizens struggle to hold government accountable for addressing their concerns, while administrators lack comprehensive analytics to prioritize and manage grievances effectively.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

*Project Name:* **CivicChain - Transparent Civic Governance Platform**  

CivicChain is a modern React-based civic governance platform that leverages Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology for mandatory Aadhaar verification. Our solution ensures transparent grievance management while preserving user privacy, prevents spam through ZKP authentication, and provides comprehensive analytics for both citizens and administrators to track government accountability in real-time.

**Key Features:**
- 🔐 Privacy-preserving Aadhaar ZKP verification
- 📊 National public leaderboard for state-wise performance
- 🎯 AI-powered grievance categorization and insights
- 📈 Real-time analytics and comprehensive dashboards
- 🏛️ Transparent government accountability tracking
